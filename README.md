# Experiments with the LEABRA algorithm

Experiments with the LEABRA algorithm from O'Reilly as part of the project of the course "Modeling in Neuroscience" taught by Jean-Pierre Nadal, MVA master.

There are four experiments:
- [Two neurons](two_neurons.ipynb)
- [Pattern association shallow](pattern_association.ipynb)
- [Pattern association deep](error_driven_hidden.ipynb)
- [Iris classification](iris_dataset.ipynb)

The slides of the project presentation are available [here](presentation_slides.pdf), while the project report is shared [there](project_report.pdf).
